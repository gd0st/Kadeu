# Kadeu

A CLI first flashcard application with a focus on serailized data formats.

## Usage
As of this writing, Kadeu is in a very infint format as I get better at working with TUIs, App run loops and how to schedule cards. However, the application *is* usable.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gd0st/kadeu
cd kadeu
cargo run -- --from flashcards/blue_oyster.json # I've included a working format
```
