# Kadeu

A CLI first flashcard application with a focus on serailized data formats.

## Usage
As of this writing, Kadeu is in a very infint format as I get better at working with TUIs, App run loops and how to schedule cards. However, the application *is* usable.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gd0st/kadeu
cd kadeu
cargo run -- --from flashcards/blue_oyster.json # I've included a working format
```


## Issues
Suggestions are appreciated, but there is not active bug handling because the project is still fresh and under heavy development.

## Library Documentation
Kadeu also comes with a library that will allow you to define custom import types for your applications. This still needs to be documented more.
